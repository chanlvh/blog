A small web application which I & my team developed in Global Youth Summit 2013\. Its main function is to help you diagnose bad posture problem by comparing your posture on a photo & the standard posture. It's very simple to use:

1.  Login by facebook at [http://posture.chan.io/index.html](http://posture.chan.io/index.html)
2.  Accept camera usage of browser, then take a photo of yourself
3.  Mark 5 points on your spine
4.  The app will automatically calculate the distance from your posture & the optimal posture, then give you a notice on what's wrong with your posture.
