Frame is another way to represent knowledge. It's like a class with multiple properties. For example the class eat represent the eating action: it has subject, object, utensils, is the object alive or not...

This way of representing the knowledge allow us to provide default values as common sense knowledge. Think of the object alive as defaulting to dead, since most of the time people eat dead things. At the same time, we can customize the knowledge for special cases, such as people in South Korea eat raw octopus.

We can also represent complex knowledge using this structure. The subject of "eat" can be another frame which has its own properties: name, type (person/ animal...)

 _This is an ongoing series of posts where I try to learn a concept by writing blog post about it. The screen shots from this post is taken from theÂ [KBAI course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud409) in Udacity._
