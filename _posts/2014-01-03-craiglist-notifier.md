[![](/uploads/craigslist_logo-150x150.png)](/uploads/craigslist_logo.png)Tired of searching Craigslist again and again to see if someone has just posted a new listing? My new Chrome Extension Craigslist Notifier does just that - check the search result every 5 minutes and automatically notify you of any update. Anything you viewed will not show up again as notification, and the viewed list is synced across your chrome browsers/ devices.   ----- **Jul 20th, 2014 : Due to craigslist's recent updates, I've taken down the tool to update the code** ------

# How to use

You can download it for free from Google Extension Store: To track a new search result, first do a search on craigslist and land on the search result page. Then, click on Craigslist Notifier's icon near the address bar, click "Track the new address". The number of new results will be displayed on the extension's icon. When you click on the icon, it'll show you all the new results and mark all of them as "already read".

# In the future

*   Make "Better Craigslist" chrome extension to improve the craigslist website itself.
*   Track multiple adress/location at the same time
*   Do the initial search from the extension
*   Allow user to set default craigslist location & category
